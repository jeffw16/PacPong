# PacPong
A variation of Pong with the third player being Pac-Man, trying to eat the ball.

## Authors and their contributions
* Jarod Norwood - primary game programmer
* Nicholas Roth - graphics and audio designer
* Jeffrey Wang - project planner

### Jarod Norwood's contributions
Jarod was the primary author of the game, writing most of the jFrame methods and the main game loop. He designed most of the game structure. This includes all key and mouse listeners, cursor invisibility, paddle and ball physics (the ball's bounce off the paddle), movement of in-game sprites such as Pac-Man and the paddles, the start screen animation, counting of the score after Pac-Man "eats" the ball, incrementing of score if the ball bounces on the left or right edge of the canvas/jPanel, Pac-Man opening and closing his mouth, including the correct direction in which Pac-Man moves.

### Nicholas Roth's contributions
Nicholas was responsible for our sounds and our game sprites, including the Pac-Men, "waka-waka" sound, and the scores. He also helped design the proportions of the game. He worked with Jarod to design the ball speed.

### Jeffrey Wang's contributions
Jeffrey was responsible for coordinating the overall project, gathering consensus for ideas and approving ideas proposed by other group members. In addition, he was responsible for writing some mutator and accessor methods within the files, as well as helping Jarod with his requests. Jeffrey was able to assist with debugging of many problems within the game, including jar file compatibility. In addition to forwarding helpful resources, he implemented the jFrame full screen option, allowing the game to run full screen. He stressed object-oriented principles within the code, forcing certain elements to be grouped in their own classes, contributing to readability, and later, debugging.
